<summary>Akshay's Engineering Story</summary>

I started my journey into technology driven by curiosity — not just about how software works, but why certain systems scale effortlessly while others break under pressure.

Over the years, that curiosity evolved into craftsmanship.

From building full-scale MERN applications to designing secure backend architectures with role-based access control, audit logging, and cloud integrations, I’ve learned that good software isn’t just about writing code — it’s about ownership, clarity, and long-term thinking.

My work spans real-time systems, secure authentication models, cloud deployments, and production-grade APIs. I enjoy designing systems that are not only functional but resilient — systems that can handle growth, complexity, and real-world unpredictability.

I approach engineering with a product mindset:
• Understand the problem deeply  
• Design thoughtfully  
• Build cleanly  
• Deploy responsibly  
• Improve continuously  

I believe strong systems are built by engineers who care about details — from architecture decisions down to the smallest edge case.

Today, I focus on building scalable backend systems, intuitive interfaces, and AI-integrated solutions that solve meaningful business problems.

Still learning. Still building. Always improving.
